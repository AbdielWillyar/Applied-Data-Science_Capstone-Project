# IBM Applied Data Science Capstone Project

Welcome to the IBM Applied Data Science Capstone project repository! This comprehensive project takes you through various stages of data science, from data collection and wrangling to exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL, interactive visualizations with Folium, and predictive analysis.

## Project Overview

In this capstone project, we tackle a real-world data science problem, applying a wide range of skills and techniques acquired throughout the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program. The project is divided into several key phases:

### 1. Data Collection and Wrangling
Learn how we collected and cleaned the raw data, transforming it into a structured format suitable for analysis. This phase includes data acquisition, data cleaning, and data preprocessing.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with SQL
Explore the data using SQL queries to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. We'll demonstrate how SQL can be a powerful tool for EDA, allowing you to dive deep into the dataset.

### 3. Interactive Visualizations with Folium
Experience interactive geospatial visualizations created using Folium. We'll showcase how geographic data can be visualized to gain a better understanding of the information hidden within.

### 4. Predictive Analysis
Discover how we applied predictive modeling techniques to make data-driven predictions. We'll explain the choice of algorithms, model evaluation, and insights gained from the predictive analysis.
